# HTMLPageCreator
## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a C++ program capable of...
1. Processing an HTML document (Formatted correctly, IE as an export of the program)
2. Displaying all information on the terminal, allowing for easy parsing and changing of said HTML document
3. Exporting said HTML document with chosen headers and all HTML tags.

##Usage
This program is primarily for me to test C++ capabilities in processing and writing to HTML documents. It is not for commercial use.

##Current Features:
- The ability to read an HTML document, keeping information about a linked CSS stylesheet and title as well as listing all HTML tags.
- Displaying all relevent information about the loaded document.
- Implimentation of <p> and <h> tags, as well as setting classes (created in a linked CSS stylesheet) and writing directly to a line on the doc.

##Features to add:
- Expanded preset tag commands (for images and links)
- CSS Stylesheet parsing and editing
- More refined header parsing

##Example of what this program is capable of
